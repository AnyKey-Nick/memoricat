# MEMCAT Skeleton

This repository contains a minimal skeleton for the MEMCAT application.

## Backend

The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

### Setup

```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The server expects `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET` variables in `.env`.

## Frontend

The frontend uses Vite and React.

### Setup

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on port 3000.

## Notes

This is only a starting point illustrating basic structure with user registration, login, and course import endpoints.
